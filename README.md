Hi ! ðŸ‘‹ 

My name is J-E, I work in the South of France in the Tech industry, and I'm passionate about Cross-Platforms Mobile App Developmment.
Especially, I really love the [.NET MAUI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/maui/what-is-maui) Framework (formerly Xamarin.Forms) on which I'm sharing some tutos on my blog : [mauicestclair.fr](http://mauicestclair.fr).

Also, I'm the author of the beauty app [MyVanity](https://en.myvanity-app.com) which is built in Xamarin.Forms.
